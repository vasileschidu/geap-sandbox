# Playbook — proto-engineer (GEAP prototype code)

Read this whole file before every code job. **Append to „Lessons” after every job** (what broke,
what the user corrected, what review/QA found) — one dated line each, with the fix. Promote a
lesson into the sections above when it has proved itself twice. Never delete a lesson.

## The codebase
- Static prototype, no build: `e-permits-acte-permisive.html` (+ shell pages), JS in
  `js/e-permits-shell.js` (one big IIFE — find code by its comment headers), demo states in
  `js/demo-states.js`, CSS in `css/e-permits-acte-permisive.css` (+ `css/e-permits-shell.css`).
  `css/main.css` = library, identical to `Components/css/main.css` — never edit; never touch
  `Components/*`, `acte-permisive/`, `msupport/`.
- Served for checks on `http://localhost:8935` (no-cache server). After CSS/JS changes bump
  `?v=tarife-vNN` in the 5 pages (e-permits-acte-permisive, mpass-test, bo-login, e-permits-shell,
  index) — and `e-permits-shell.css?v=hover-vN` when that file changes.
- Data: `data/e-permits-services.json` (services, flows, authorities), `data/e-permits-rssp-people.json`
  (authorities with subdivisions = `rsspDb`), users in `data/e-permits-users.json`.

## Workflow
1. Read the user story in Azure (project GEAP, read-only — never edit US/AC text; comments only
   when the user asks) and the Figma reference; list the ACs you will cover.
2. **Check components.md first** (Component Inventory) and reuse exact helpers/classes:
   `renderFoSelectControl`, `renderCheckOption` (supports `icon`, `required`), `renderToggle`,
   `renderTag`, `renderInfoNote`, `renderStackedList` / `renderRowActions` / `renderStackMenu`,
   `askConfirm`, `showShellToast`, `logServiceEvents` (→ „Modificări nepublicate”), drawers
   `.e-permits-user-create` (+ `--wide`, `__section` / `__section-title` / `__section-content`),
   grids `.e-permits-user-create__grid` + `__field--6/12`, blocks `.e-permits-tax-cond`
   (+ `--outline`), segmented `.segmented-control` (standard size only).
3. Build: tokens only (`var(--…)` with fallbacks), no inline styles, no new class unless nothing
   exists — then document it in components.md (inventory row + section) the same turn.
4. Add demo states for every meaningful state (default, filled, empty, validation error, menus
   open, confirmations, no-rights). Helpers: `svc(tab, run, code)`, `cfgNav`, `docOpen`,
   `docMenu` (opens ⋮ via the visible row button — hidden menu items fail `h.find`), `rtAviz`.
5. Verify: `node --check`, then capture states:
   `node --experimental-websocket --no-warnings tools/persona-test/capture.mjs --states <ids> --out <scratch>`
   (desktop + mobile, console errors, overflow). Drawer content scrolls inside the drawer — use a
   scrolled screenshot when needed. Look at the PNGs.
6. **QA**: run the `ui-qa-code` agent (states + scope). Fix majors, re-run. For bigger features
   run the persona review (`/persona-review` style: admin-platforma, spec-auditor,
   design-system-guardian, editor-romana, accesibilitate → verifier).
7. Commit with the attribution line; push only to `sandbox` (branch + `HEAD:main`), never
   origin, never force; `docs.png` / `docs/` stay out.

## Rules (from the user — never break)
- Obligatoriu = checkbox option with red star (never Da/Nu, never a switch).
- Button icon colour = label colour. „Editează” with pen; one labelled primary + ⋮ per row.
- No monospace — except rule-builder keywords as `code.e-permits-doc-kw` tokens.
- Applicant types: icon + full name in forms/read-only views; plain codes in stacked list meta.
- Hover visible everywhere; open button keeps focus ring (`aria-expanded`); no toast for toggles.
- Last row without divider; truncated text gets a tooltip; dates „8 iulie 2026”.
- Opening animations use `animation-fill-mode: backwards` (never `both`) and open modals drop
  their layer — otherwise hover stops repainting in GPU Chrome.
- Floating select lists can ask for a min width: `[data-fo-list-min="120"]`.
- Long lists (> 12) → summary field + picker modal; condition builders read as code
  (`Când` / indented rows on a guide line / `și ▾`), value group = mode + input in one border.

## Gotchas
- zsh: `${…}` inside an unquoted heredoc breaks — use `<<'EOF'` and pass paths via env.
- macOS has no `timeout`; scripts must exit themselves.
- `querySelector` on a comma list returns the first in DOM order — maybe a hidden drawer; pick
  the first visible match.
- The fo-select `id` sits on its button — focus `#id`, not `#id + button`.
- Python patching: assert each `old` string exists before replacing; re-run `node --check`.

## Lessons (append — newest last)
- 2026-10-12 · Demo `docMenu` waited for a hidden menu item (fails) → open ⋮ from the row's
  visible button first.
- 2026-10-12 · The user rejected: grey nested rule blocks, separate segmented controls for
  Valoare/Alt câmp and și/sau, icon badges for PF/PJ in list rows, a segmented și/sau, a box
  around composite fields (→ lines only), Da/Nu for Obligatoriu. Prefer quiet, sentence-like
  builders and existing components.
- 2026-10-12 · ui-qa-code first run: chevron colour ≠ label in the „Valoare ▾” group; an off-scale
  17px indent → use 8 margin + 1px transparent border + 16 padding.
- 2026-10-12 · PO asked „care este scopul acestui checkbox?” on the classifier values table → the
  selection column (bulk Activează/Dezactivează) was removed everywhere; no checkbox columns unless
  a story asks for bulk actions. Without the select column, the first cell pads 16 (toolbar line).
- 2026-10-12 · Solicitările mele + catalog in `cabinet-evo/` (one page, `?view=` + `?as=`; new views
  are separate files fed by `window.CabEvo` from cabinet-evo.js). Reusing the FO vocabulary (summary
  card, finish tracker/timeline, callout, roles, confirm-file rows, confirm + doc modals) covered a whole
  EVO profile with ~10 glue classes — look in the FO wizard before inventing for any EVO screen.
- 2026-10-12 · A `sed` that deleted „unused” `const status = …` lines also hit `statusTag()` (same
  indent) → every tag read „Undefined” (bare `status` = `window.status`). Never sed-delete by line text;
  edit the one occurrence with Python + assert count == 1.
- 2026-10-12 · Library `.status-tag` is `text-transform: capitalize` → „În Așteptare”. Romanian labels are
  sentence case: scope `text-transform: none` (cab page, BO dosar profile already does it).
- 2026-10-12 · The FO intent menu stretches `left:0; right:0` at ≤720 — any reuse (`cab-menu`) must
  re-anchor on mobile; a left-side menu trigger near the edge needs `margin-left:auto` so the menu opens
  leftwards. Check open menus at 375 (capture overflow > 0 is the tell).
- 2026-10-12 · `cabinet-evo/` does not load e-permits-shell.css → the global „open button keeps the focus
  ring” rule was missing there; pages outside the shell need it copied (`.cab-page .btn[aria-expanded]`).
- 2026-10-12 · empty-state.js / FO markup use root-relative `assets/…`; on sub-pages rewrite to `../assets/`
  (`fixAssets`). capture.mjs only says „ok” when demoState is set — `id:error` also counts as set; check
  `document.documentElement.dataset.demoState` for `:error` (scratch `check.mjs`) and items on page 2 of a
  paginated list (filter first).
- 2026-10-12 · Full-page captures put fixed modals/tooltips wherever the page was scrolled; for modal
  states take a viewport screenshot (CDP `Page.captureScreenshot`). A `scroll` listener that hides a
  tooltip kills it when the demo helper `h.hover` scrolls it into view — position absolute in document
  coordinates instead.
- 2026-10-12 · No sub-agent tool in this session → ran `tools/ui-qa/code-audit.mjs` per
  `.claude/agents/ui-qa-code.md` myself. Real finds: chip icon colour ≠ label (cab Filtre pinned #121212),
  brand-blue check in menus (icon = label colour), truncated summary labels on mobile (wrap them).
  Standing false positives: `e-permits-fo-copy-value` (button-not-library / icon colour), open menus
  overlapping content, `.u-visually-hidden` „clipped”, FO timeline gray-50.
- 2026-10-12 · „hover breaks after I click something”: page-reveal.js re-marked items on every
  re-render and only cleared its latest run, leaving older items with `animation … both` +
  `will-change` (GPU Chrome stops repainting :hover). Fixed: reveal = `backwards`, no will-change,
  every run clears its own items; all opening (`-in`) animations in the app CSS → `backwards`.
  Test it headless: two clicks < 520ms apart, then hover a row (scratchpad hover.mjs pattern).
- 2026-10-12 · `<a class="btn">` underlined on hover (library global `a:hover`) → `a.btn` never
  underlines. Cabinet dropdowns = BO buttons (`btn-neutral btn-sm`, 16 icon, chevron), menus =
  `.e-permits-stack__menu` size, ⋮ = `btn-strict btn-sm btn-icon-only` (32, radius 6).
- 2026-10-13 · US-54 (address by cadastral code): the FO „Detalii solicitare” address is the JS
  `cascadeAddressHtml` (label „Caută adresa”), not the static HTML block — and it is step 2 = `fo-03`
  (fo-04 is Acte necesare). Schema flags on the field (`cadastral`) + `?param` demo overrides kept
  the change local; `postprocessSectionHtml` spreads the same field, so post-process 10 inherits it.
- 2026-10-13 · `el.focus()` in a background headless tab fires NO focus event → focus-driven lists
  never opened in demo states (they did in a real browser). Demo runs dispatch
  `new FocusEvent("focus")` after `h.focus`. Also list options listen to `mousedown`, so a demo
  must dispatch `mousedown` (h.click sends only click).
- 2026-10-13 · capture.mjs prints „ok” even for `id:error` — always run a scratch checker reading
  `dataset.demoState` + probing the DOM (scratchpad check.mjs pattern) before trusting a capture.
- 2026-10-13 · `bindCascadeSelect.setValue()` focuses the select button → a programmatic fill steals
  focus from the field the user is typing in; give focus back (or blur) after filling.
- 2026-10-13 · Registry-filled FO fields = `.e-permits-fo-input.is-filled.is-readonly` + green
  `icon-checkmark-small` (the FO Read Only state), never a lock. For selects: hide the select, insert a
  read-only input box; one full-width `renderInfoNote` explains them (a hint under one span-6 field
  wrapped to 3 lines and broke the row). New field-message tones `__warning` / `__loading` live next to
  `__success`. Another agent bumped `?v=` mid-job (v51→v53): re-read before bumping.
- 2026-10-13 · eKYC back office = a **product mode** of the BO page, not a copy: `?flow=ekyc` maps to the
  back-office flow (all `[data-demo-flow="back-office"]` CSS applies), `js/ekyc.js` in `<head>` sets
  `window.GEAPShellProduct`, the shell exposes its engine through `product.init(api)` and ~15 small
  hooks (roles URL, nav dispatch, renderCell / search / sort / filterToken / facets / openRow / export /
  emptyHtml, route, logout). A whole new back office (shell, 2 registries, profile with 5 tabs,
  dashboard) cost ~900 lines of product JS + ~300 lines of CSS. Next product: copy this pattern.
- 2026-10-13 · BO traps a product hits: `.e-permits-shell__nav-group--config` is `display:none` (legacy) →
  gate it with `!product`; registries without a checkbox column inherit the pinned „column 2 +
  divider” rule → add the kind to the „no checkbox column” selector lists; a plain table inside a
  section needs the same unpinning; a modifier that changes `grid-template-columns` (trajectory
  `--nN`) overrides the ≤760px stacking unless wrapped in `@media (min-width: 761px)` — the QA's
  clipped-text on mobile was the tell.
- 2026-10-13 · Data-driven widths without inline styles: SVG `<rect width="62%">` (meter, chart) —
  attributes, not `style=""`. Onest tabular-nums renders „1 1:44” with a visible gap → don't use it.
- 2026-10-13 · Several mobile `:error` states (trf-01, srv-01) are pre-existing: the nav click target
  is hidden ≤960px. Proved it against HEAD in a `git worktree` served on another port (never stash
  while another agent edits the tree).
- 2026-10-13 · Generator gotcha: `arr.find((c) => c.id === pick(list))` calls the random pick per
  element → undefined; pick once, then find. Undecided sessions must have `finalScore: null`.
